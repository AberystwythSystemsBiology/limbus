Usage Questions
---------------

If you have questions about how to use LImBuS, or have an issue that isn't 
related to a bug - feel free to email_ us - and we'll try and get back to you 
as soon as possible.

Bug Reports
-----------

Part of being free and open is our willingness to participate in public bug 
tracking. We make use of GitHub to help orchestrate development of LImBuS. If 
you would like to submit a bug report then you are required to sign up, but 
don't worry - it's complete free to use.

We understand that many of our users are going to be new to to this, and 
understand that it may be difficult to submit your first bug. We advise that 
you follow this simple step-by-step guide to get started:

1. Visit the "Issues_" page on our GitHub.
2. Search the issue list to ensure that your report hasn't been filed already. 
   If your report has already been filed by someone else, comment that you are 
   experiencing the same problem - so we know that you're also affected.
3. If you believe your bug is a new one, then feel free to create a "New 
   Issue". Type in a complete (more on this shortly) summary and description
   of your issue and submit it.


What makes a good issue?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here are a couple of pointers on how to submit a good issue:

* **Specific Summary:** Think of the summary as the title of the issue you're 
  reporting. It's important to be specific because it makes our lives easier 
  when searching. Submitting a summary like "it doesn't work" doesn't really 
  help us achieve that. Instead consider something like "Unable to submit 
  transfer request" or "Error when viewing User Profile".
* **Provide Information:** Provide as much information you can including, 
  where appropriate, the error (in full) that has been thrown.
* **Help us Help you:** We may ask you to provide more information. Failure to
  assist will likely lead to us closing the issue, even if the problem hasn't 
  been fixed.
  
Feature Requests
----------------

Feel free to submit a feature request using our GitHub's Issues_ page. We ask 
that you are respectful when making a request, and not provide negative 
feedback about existing features - instead please use positive language - and
present it in a way that will get us excited to add your feature to our project. 

Priority Support

support, feel free to drop us an email and we'll get back to you with more information.
