First-time setup
================

When you first deploy LImBuS, you are required to undertake the first time
setup. This is a quick process, which will get you set up with an administrator
account, and a base site. A site is a location where samples are collected,
processed, and stored. Whilst it it possible to set up multiple sites, the setup
procedure only involves setting up one.

After you have deployed LImBuS, navigate to :code:`http://your.domain.here/setup`,
where :code:`http://your.domain.here` is replaced with your domain. If successful,
you should be greeted with the following page:
