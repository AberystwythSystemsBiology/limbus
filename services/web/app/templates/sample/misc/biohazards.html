                    <h3>Procedures and Practices</h3>

                    <ol>
                        <li>All persons entering the laboratory must be advised of the potential hazards and meet specific entry/exit requirements.</li>
                        <li>Laboratory personnel must be provided medical surveillance, as appropriate and offered available immunisations for agents handled or potentially present in the laboratory.</li>
                        <li>Each institution should consider the need for collection and storage of serum samples from at-risk personnel.</li>
                        <li>A laboratory-specific biosafety manual must be prepared and adopted as policy. The biosafety manual must be available and accessible.</li>
                        <li>The laboratory supervisor must ensure that laboratory personnel demonstrate proficiency in standard and special microbiological practices before working with BSL-2 agents.</li>
                        <li>Potentially infectious materials must be placed in a durable, leak-proof container during collection, handling, processing, storage or transport within a facility.</li>
                        <li>Laboratory equipment should be routinely decontaminated, as well as after spills, splashes or other potential contamination.</li>
                        <li>Incidents that may result in exposure to infectious materials must be immediately evaluated and treated according to procedures described in the laboratory biosafety manual. All such incidents must be reported to the laboratory supervisor. Medical evaluation, surveillance and treatment should be provided and appropriate records maintained.</li>
                        <li>Animals and plants not associated with the work being performed must not be permitted in the laboratory.</li>

                    <h3>Safety Equipment</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Properly maintained BSCs, other appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) or other physical containment devices must be used whenever:</li>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Procedures with a potential for creating infectious aerosols or splashes are conducted. These may include pipetting, centrifuging, grinding, blending, shaking, mixing, sonicating, opening containers of infectious materials, inoculating animals intranasally and harvesting infected tissues from animals or eggs.</li>
                            <li>High concentrations or large volumes of infectious agents are used. Such materials may be centrifuged in the open laboratory using sealed rotor heads or centrifuge safety cups.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <li>Protective laboratory coats, gowns, smocks or uniforms designated for laboratory use must be worn while working with hazardous materials. Protective clothing must be removed before leaving for non-laboratory areas. Protective clothing must be disposed of appropriately, or deposited for laundering by the institution. It is suggested that laboratory clothing not be taken home.</li>
                        <li>Eye and face protection (goggles, mask, faceshield or other splatter guard) is to be used for anticipated splashes or sprays of infectious or other hazardous materials when the microorganisms must be handled outside the BSC or containment device. Eye and face protection must be disposed of with other contaminated laboratory waste or decontaminated before reuse. Persons who wear contact lenses in laboratories should also wear eye protection.</li>
                        <li>Gloves must be worn to protect hands from exposure to hazardous materials. Glove selection should be based on an appropriate risk assessment. Alternatives to latex gloves should be available.</li>
                        <li>Gloves must not be worn outside the laboratory. In addition, BSL-2 laboratory workers should:</li>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Change gloves when contaminated, glove integrity is compromised or when otherwise necessary.</li>
                                <li>Remove gloves and wash hands when work with hazardous materials has been completed and before leaving the laboratory.</li>
                                <li>Not wash or reuse disposable gloves. Used gloves must be disposed of with other contaminated laboratory waste. Hand washing protocols must be rigorously followed.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <li>Eye, face and respiratory protection should be used in rooms containing infected animals as determined by the risk assessment.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3>Facilities</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Biological safety cabinets (BSCs) must be installed so that fluctuations of the room air supply and exhaust do not interfere with proper operations. BSCs should be located away from doors, windows that can be opened, heavily traveled laboratory areas and other possible airflow disruptions.</li>
                        <li>Vacuum lines should be protected with liquid disinfectant traps.</li>
                        <li>An eyewash station must be readily available.</li>
                        <li>There are no specific requirements for ventilation systems. However, planning of new facilities should consider mechanical ventilation systems that provide an inward flow of air without recirculation to spaces outside of the laboratory.</li>
                        <li>High efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtered exhaust air from a Class II BSC can be safely recirculated back into the laboratory environment if the cabinet is tested and certified at least annually and operated according to manufacturerâ€™s recommendations. BSCs can also be connected to the laboratory exhaust system by either a thimble (canopy) connection or directly exhausted to the outside through a hard connection. Provisions to assure proper safety cabinet performance and air system operation must be verified.</li>
                        <li>A method for decontaminating all laboratory wastes should be available in the facility (e.g., autoclave, chemical disinfection, incineration or other validated decontamination method).</li>
